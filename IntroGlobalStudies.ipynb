        "It's a surprisingly hard definition to nail down, especially given how ubiquitous the term has become.\n",

        "In my mind, these critiques miss something important.\n",
        "Data science, despite its hype-laden veneer, is perhaps the best label we have for the cross-disciplinary set of skills that are becoming increasingly important in many applications across industry and academia.\n",
